## Basic Rules
- Two players choose to either cooperate or defect in each round. The payoffs are based on the combination of choices.

- The game is played repeatedly, allowing strategies to evolve based on the history of interactions. (iterative)

- Ran a game for 10,000 iterations, and trained models on the data


- Consider using weighted history (geometric progression).
- So the first few decisions weigh much less than the most recent.
- Try minor neural network.

- Go for a mathematical approach
