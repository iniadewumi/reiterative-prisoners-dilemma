Here are some key patterns and insights I noticed from analyzing the last 150 rounds of the simulation:

Cooper (always cooperate) continues to be exploited by the defecting agents like Devin, scoring the lowest overall. Cooper's score keeps decreasing as it cooperates while others defect against it.
Devin (always defect) maintains one of the highest scores by continually defecting, though its score gain has slowed as most agents have learned to defect back.
The responsive agents like Tit-for-Tat (Titi) and Tit-for-2-Tat (Tata) are generally doing well, ending up in the middle of the pack. They cooperate with each other but defect against regular defectors.
Randy (random) and the various machine learning agents have stabilized to mostly defecting against each other with the occasional random cooperation. No clear advantage for the learning agents.
The Evolutionary (Groot) and Adaptive (Prosper) agents seem to be holding steady with a balance of cooperation and defection depending on the opponent.
Overall defection has become the dominant strategy in later rounds as cooperation gets exploited. Early cooperators like Titi and Tata have been forced to defect more.
Destiny remains the highest scoring agent overall, likely due to its early round success with its decision tree strategy. But its advantage over Devin has disappeared.
Eureka and Groot employing probabilistic & heuristic strategies perform decently but don't seem to have a clear edge over simpler strategies like Tit-for-Tat.
In summary, while some adaptive and machine learning agents achieved success early, over time simple defection has become dominant, with early cooperators forced to defect more in response. Exploitation of cooperators drives the system towards defection. Responsive strategies perform best in this environment shaped by the relative proportion of cooperators vs defectors over time.
