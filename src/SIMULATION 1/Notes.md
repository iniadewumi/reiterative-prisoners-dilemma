# Patterns and Improvements for Agent Strategies
While defection might be a good starting strategy, it is not a good long term strategy, even among non-complex agents, reputation becomes a thing, and once reputations are created, the only time defection works is when the other agents do not adapt, or ignore the reputation of their opponent (like in the case of cooper). Devin exploits Cooper in every round, gaining points while Cooper loses points. The same pattern occurs with Destiny vs Cooper.



## Adaptive Agent
- Pattern: The Adaptive Agent performed well against agents with consistent strategies but struggled against agents that frequently changed their behavior.
- Improvement: Implement a more sophisticated learning algorithm that can adapt to changing opponent strategies more quickly. Consider using reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or SARSA to update the agent's strategy based on the rewards received in each round.

## Decision Tree Agent
- Pattern: The Decision Tree Agent performed well overall but had difficulty against agents with more complex strategies that couldn't be easily captured by a decision tree.
- Improvement: Experiment with different decision tree hyperparameters, such as tree depth and minimum samples per leaf, to find the optimal balance between model complexity and generalization. Additionally, consider using an ensemble of decision trees, such as a Random Forest, to improve robustness and handle more complex opponent strategies.

## Probabilistic Agent
- Pattern: The Probabilistic Agent's performance was sensitive to the choice of the cooperation probability threshold. It performed well against agents with similar cooperation rates but struggled against agents with significantly different strategies.
- Improvement: Implement an adaptive threshold that adjusts based on the opponent's behavior. Start with a default threshold and update it dynamically based on the observed cooperation rate of the opponent. This will allow the agent to adapt to different types of opponents more effectively.

## Heuristic Agent
- Pattern: The Heuristic Agent's performance was heavily dependent on the specific heuristics used. While it performed well against agents that matched the heuristics' assumptions, it struggled against agents with more sophisticated strategies.
- Improvement: Develop a more diverse set of heuristics that capture a wider range of opponent behaviors. Consider incorporating heuristics based on the opponent's response to the agent's actions, such as detecting patterns of reciprocation or retaliation. Additionally, implement a mechanism to switch between different heuristics based on their performance against each opponent.

## Tit-for-Tat Agent
- Pattern: The Tit-for-Tat Agent performed well in promoting cooperation but was vulnerable to exploitation by agents that consistently defected.
- Improvement: Implement a "Generous Tit-for-Tat" variant that occasionally forgives defection and cooperates even if the opponent defected in the previous round. This can help prevent cycles of mutual defection and promote cooperation in the long run.

## Random Agent
- Pattern: The Random Agent's performance was consistently poor, as expected, due to its lack of strategic decision-making.
- Improvement: While the Random Agent serves as a baseline, consider replacing it with more advanced random strategies, such as epsilon-greedy exploration or Thompson sampling, to balance exploration and exploitation.

## Always Cooperate and Always Defect Agents
- Pattern: The Always Cooperate Agent was easily exploited by defecting agents, while the Always Defect Agent performed well against cooperative agents but struggled in promoting overall cooperation.
- Improvement: These agents serve as important baselines to evaluate the performance of other strategies. Consider using them as benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of more advanced agents in promoting cooperation or exploiting simple strategies.
